# Tenta Setup

1. Setup Tenta, according to the Tenta documentation: https://github.com/iterize/tenta
2. In the Tenta dashboard, create a new sensor node -> you will receive a "sensor identifier".
3. Use the `config.default.json` file to create a `config.json` file on your sensor node. Set `general.config_revision` to `-1` and `general.system_identifier` to the "sensor identifier" you received from Tenta.

   ```json
   {
     "general": {
        "config_revision": -1,
        "software_version": "1.1.0",
        "system_identifier": "ab12cd..."
     },
     "backend": {
       "provider": "tenta",
       "mqtt_connection": ...
     },
   }
   ```

4. When publishing new configurations with Tenta, you can omit the field `general.config_revision`, because Tenta will assign new revision numbers automatically. The system identifier is required, so the sensor node knows on which MQTT topics to communicate.
5. The first configuration created by Tenta receives config revision `0`.

  In [Hermes](https://github.com/tum-esm/hermes), we solved these initial steps
  with setup script for each Raspberry Pi that put an initial config with a
  sensor identifier on the device and published this initial config to Tenta.
